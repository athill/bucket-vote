# Bucket Vote

[Current Demo](http://bucket-vote.andyhill.us/)

## Premise

At my church ([United Presbyterian Church in Bloomington, IN](http://upcbloomington.org/)), a committee I am on had to choose the group that will find our next pastor. We had 15 or so prospects, but needed 7 members for the group. We did what I call a "bucket vote" (though I can't seem to find a use of this term anywhere.) The way ours worked was each voter could select 10 prospects and the 7 who got the most votes were asked first. 

This app provides a graphical way to cast and tally the votes.
